            <h2 id="intro-the-anatomy-of-a-frame">The anatomy of a frame</h2>
            <p>To create a solid foundation on which to build the rest of this
            thesis, I'll start with an obvious question: What is a frame? When we
            attempt to answer this question, we quickly see that there are several
            entrances to the world of frames. Let's have a look at the meaning of
            the word "frame" itself. In the English language there are many things
            that can be described by the word <em>frame,</em> ranging from ancient
            to contemporary, from miniscule to enormous and from physical to
            metaphorical. Some examples are doorframes, timeframes, frame-of-mind,
            picture frames, frames per second. The list goes on and on. As you can
            see, they describe quite different things, and if we consult a
            dictionary about the word frame, we are met with a wide range of
            definitions. For each different use of the word, a slightly different
            definition is used. One recurring descriptor among the definitions is
            the word "structure"<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
            ><sup>1</sup></a>. But instinctively, it seems to me
            that structure is not the only commonality that all different frames
            share. Therefore, I will attempt to define a clear set of purposes and
            characteristics of a frame in this chapter. I believe this will be
            helpful to understanding the rest of this thesis. As the title of this
            chapter suggests I will discuss these properties in a similar manner to
            an anatomy, dissecting and isolating the individual parts that a frame
            consists of <span class="clickMe fig2">(fig. 2)</span>.</p>
