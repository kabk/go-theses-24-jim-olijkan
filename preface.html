            <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>The idea for this thesis originated in an aesthetical interest in the
decorative calligraphy and illustrations found in illuminated
manuscripts from the middle-ages <span class="clickMe fig1">(fig. 1)</span>. Within these beautifully handcrafted books, one can find hidden meaning
and information. But rather than by reading the books, the magic happens
in their margins. In the margins of these masterpieces, entire
narratives unfold, in the form of ornament, illustration and other
scribbles. Besides functioning as a decorative frame for the text, this
so called "marginalia" can teach us a lot about the society and
circumstances, in which the manuscript was created. (I will return to
this in a later chapter...)</p>
<p>The discovery that not only the surface level content, but also the
frame surrounding it can hold information and add context, sparked my
curiosity. In this thesis I wish to expand this newfound interest to all
sorts of frames and the act of framing itself. I am curious to see what
I can learn from looking at frames in different scenarios. Through this
research I hope to develop a way of critically looking at the world
around me, and to consume information in a more consciously.</p>
