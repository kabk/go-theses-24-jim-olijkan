            <h2>3. To endow with importance</h2>
            <p>As we just concluded, each act of framing is the result of a curation
            (though not necessarily deliberate or conscious). Because of this, we
            can assume that whatever is framed holds some degree of importance to
            the framer. A grandparent framing a drawing made by their grandchild is
            an obvious example <span class="clickMe fig6">(fig. 6)</span>. The grandparent
            probably won't care much about the artistic value of the drawing because
            it is the grandchild that is important to them.</p>
            <p>With this logic, we can look at the act of framing as a ritual that
            bestows a certain validity and authority over the framed. A lacklustre
            drawing that is hung on the refrigerator may be ugly, but the mere fact
            that it was put on display is a statement that tells anyone who sees it,
            that the drawing is important to the fridge-owner. Even though there was
            not literal frame in this example, the act of putting an item on
            display, can be regarded as framing. Making it no different than an
            expensive gilded frame in a museum.</p>
            <p>If we look at a frame beyond its physical container as the
            institution it represents, we start to see how the credibility of the
            author is transmitted to the contents by the used medium. Think of the
            instantly recognisable blue envelopes that have become synonymous with
            the Dutch tax administration <span class="clickMe fig7">(fig. 7)</span>. If these
            bills were instead handwritten in coloured pencils, covered in sparkly
            stickers, and full of grammatical errors, we would question their
            legitimacy and be hesitant to pay them.</p>
            <p>But the opposite is also true. A veil of credibility and truthfulness
            can be created by replicating or appropriating certain institutional
            aesthetics. A malicious example of this is phishing emails, pretending
            to be a legitimate service to scam unwary victims. Another, more
            light-hearted example happened in 2017, when twitch-streamer A.J. Lester
            illegally broadcasted a pay-per-view UFC fight by holding a gaming
            controller and pretending to be playing a game, instead of watching a
            live event<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
