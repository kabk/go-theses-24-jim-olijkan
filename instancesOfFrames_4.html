            <h2>F**** the system (Frame the system)</h2>
            <p>On January 24th, 2024, twitter user @Locwittati posted an image of a
            wall with a hole in it, covered up by a picture frame, to make it look
            like the damaged drywall was instead part of an artwork <span class="clickMe fig25">(fig. 25)</span>. The tweet was captioned: "I had an apartment inspection
            "<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
            ><sup>15</sup></a>. In the KABK men's bathroom in the
            graphic design department, the walls are completely covered in graffiti
            tags, but among them is a small empty wooding picture frame, placed on
            top of some deep bathroom ponderings and inspirational quotes. On top of
            the frame somebody wrote "Does art make the frame or the frame makes
            art?" <span class="clickMe fig26">(fig. 26)</span>. And though both references might
            seem a bit silly, they open a discourse about the rigid, formal
            traditions and expectations within art. And while discussing these norms
            we must also mention Marcel Duchamp's Fountain (1917), a Dada sculpture
            that challenged those same conventions <span class="clickMe fig27">(fig. 27)</span>.
            (There is some discourse about whether Duchamp was the creator of this
            work, or if it should be attributed to Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven<a
            href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
            ><sup>16</sup></a>).</p>
            <p>Today, a popular form of visual expression takes place on trashcans,
            electricity boxes, traffic lights, and other urban furniture <span class="clickMe fig28">(fig. 28,</span><span class="clickMe fig29"> fig. 29)</span>. We find all of these covered in graffiti and
            stickers. Most, if not all of these types of urban ornamentation would
            be considered vandalism by the government. But, these same urban items
            are often fitted with a reusable frame, that serves as a designated
            advertisement spot <span class="clickMe fig30">(fig. 30)</span>. In her work, Swedish artist Klara Liden (1979)
            recontextualizes these pieces of urban furniture by taking them out of
            their original context and presenting them in an exhibition <span class="clickMe fig31">(fig. 31)</span>. Her work is described as "marked by an enduring
            exploration of the physical and psychological bounds of the spaces –
            both public and private – we inhabit"<a href="#fn17"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" ><sup>17</sup></a>.
            When I see her work, I can't help but be reminded of the Fountain,
            because of the way her work highlights the mundane and creates a
            platform for more informal forms of visual media. Something about
            juxtaposing the graffiti and stickers –which will always be an underdog
            to regulated and institutional forms of media– with the "formal" context
            of a gallery, just feels so right.</p>

        <h2>F**** the system (Frame the system)</h2>
        <p>On January 24th, 2024, twitter user @Locwittati posted an image of a
        wall with a hole in it, covered up by a picture frame, to make it look
        like the damaged drywall was instead part of an artwork <span class="clickMe fig25">(fig. 25)</span>. The tweet was captioned: "I had an apartment inspection
        "<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
        ><sup>15</sup></a>. In the KABK men's bathroom in the
        graphic design department, the walls are completely covered in graffiti
        tags, but among them is a small empty wooding picture frame, placed on
        top of some deep bathroom ponderings and inspirational quotes. On top of
        the frame somebody wrote "Does art make the frame or the frame makes
        art?" <span class="clickMe fig26">(fig. 26)</span>. And though both references might
        seem a bit silly, they open a discourse about the rigid, formal
        traditions and expectations within art. And while discussing these norms
        we must also mention Marcel Duchamp's Fountain (1917), a Dada sculpture
        that challenged those same conventions <span class="clickMe fig27">(fig. 27)</span>.
        (There is some discourse about whether Duchamp was the creator of this
        work, or if it should be attributed to Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven<a
        href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
        ><sup>16</sup></a>).</p>
        <p>Today, a popular form of visual expression takes place on trashcans,
        electricity boxes, traffic lights, and other urban furniture <span class="clickMe fig28">(fig. 28,</span><span class="clickMe fig29"> fig. 29)</span>. We find all of these covered in graffiti and
        stickers. Most, if not all of these types of urban ornamentation would
        be considered vandalism by the government. But, these same urban items
        are often fitted with a reusable frame, that serves as a designated
        advertisement spot <span class="clickMe fig30">(fig. 30)</span>. In her work, Swedish artist Klara Liden (1979)
        recontextualizes these pieces of urban furniture by taking them out of
        their original context and presenting them in an exhibition <span class="clickMe fig31">(fig. 31)</span>. Her work is described as "marked by an enduring
        exploration of the physical and psychological bounds of the spaces –
        both public and private – we inhabit"<a href="#fn17"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" ><sup>17</sup></a>.
        When I see her work, I can't help but be reminded of the Fountain,
        because of the way her work highlights the mundane and creates a
        platform for more informal forms of visual media. Something about
        juxtaposing the graffiti and stickers –which will always be an underdog
        to regulated and institutional forms of media– with the "formal" context
        of a gallery, just feels so right.</p>
