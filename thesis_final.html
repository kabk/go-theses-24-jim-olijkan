<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this thesis I explore frames in visual media: The ones found in
museums and galleries, those in books and editorial design. And the
frames found in online-culture and memes. I investigate the history and
traditions of frames, and I discover how they relate to more abstract
frames, like certain social constructs and topics relating to
identity.</p>
<p>I will give a general introduction to frames, in which I dissect a
frame into its properties and functions. After this introduction, this
thesis will continue following a non-linear structure consisting of
little standalone vignettes. These little "nuggets" are not meant to be
read in any specific order. With this structure I hope to present my
research in a digestible manner.</p>
<h2 id="section"></h2>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>The idea for this thesis originated in an aesthetical interest in the
decorative calligraphy and illustrations found in illuminated
manuscripts from the middle-ages. <mark>(fig. medieval book)</mark>
Within these beautifully handcrafted books, one can find hidden meaning
and information. But rather than by reading the books, the magic happens
in their margins. In the margins of these masterpieces, entire
narratives unfold, in the form of ornament, illustration and other
scribbles. Besides functioning as a decorative frame for the text, this
so called "marginalia" can teach us a lot about the society and
circumstances, in which the manuscript was created. (I will return to
this in a later chapter...)</p>
<p>The discovery that not only the surface level content, but also the
frame surrounding it can hold information and add context, sparked my
curiosity. In this thesis I wish to expand this newfound interest to all
sorts of frames and the act of framing itself. I am curious to see what
I can learn from looking at frames in different scenarios. Through this
research I hope to develop a way of critically looking at the world
around me, and to consume information in a more consciously.</p>

<h2 id="intro-the-anatomy-of-a-frame">Intro: The anatomy of a frame</h2>
<p>To create a solid foundation on which to build the rest of this
thesis, I'll start with an obvious question: What is a frame? When we
attempt to answer this question, we quickly see that there are several
entrances to the world of frames. Let's have a look at the meaning of
the word "frame" itself. In the English language there are many things
that can be described by the word <em>frame,</em> ranging from ancient
to contemporary, from miniscule to enormous and from physical to
metaphorical. Some examples are doorframes, timeframes, frame-of-mind,
picture frames, frames per second. The list goes on and on. As you can
see, they describe quite different things, and if we consult a
dictionary about the word frame, we are met with a wide range of
definitions. For each different use of the word, a slightly different
definition is used. One recurring descriptor among the definitions is
the word "structure"<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. But instinctively, it seems to me
that structure is not the only commonality that all different frames
share. Therefore, I will attempt to define a clear set of purposes and
characteristics of a frame in this chapter. I believe this will be
helpful to understanding the rest of this thesis. As the title of this
chapter suggests I will discuss these properties in a similar manner to
an anatomy, dissecting and isolating the individual parts that a frame
consists of. <mark>(fig. anatomy lesson)</mark></p>

<p>1. Strengthening with structure</p>
<p>Let's start with perhaps the most basic property of a frame. As I
mentioned before, <em>structure</em> is an important quality that all
frames possess. In this context, structure can be seen in the literal
sense, as an almost architectural quality: A tangible structure or
system, serving as a physical support as part of another object with a
greater function. Think for example, about the frames in sunglasses and
bicycles. A painting doesn't only have a frame for aesthetical purposes,
but also to protect the canvas during transport, or other outside
influences <mark>(fig. soepgooiers)</mark>. In the context of talking
about the characteristics of a frame as an anatomy, it should also be
said that the structural qualities of a frame are not dissimilar to the
properties of a skeleton (either endo- or exoskeleton). <mark>(fig.
skeleton)</mark></p>
<p>But the idea of structure also applies to less literal instances of
frames. If I would have a conversation with one of my peers, I might
colloquially mention the term "covid times". We would both know that we
are talking about a period that lasted from 2020 to somewhere around
2022/2023. In this case an event or experience is framed by a certain
calendar system. The structure in this example comes from a (hu)manmade
system, invented to help us understand time more easily. Not only would
the event be framed by a calendar system, but our understanding and
usage of this system would also be shaped by cultural and geographical
frames. If somebody else from a different culture (or even planet), that
measures time by a different metric, would have the same conversation,
they might reach different conclusions. In this case culture can also be
seen as a frame. It is a collection of contexts and backgrounds that
form a rigid blueprint for traditions, values, and ways of
understanding.</p>

<p>2. Inclusion through exclusion</p>
<p>A frame is a curation and construction of narrative. When we frame an
artwork or photo and put it on the wall, something interesting has
happened. Regardless of whether the picture is a lovely panorama of a
meadow during a sunset, a happy family portrait or a pseudo rustic "live
laugh love" home decoration: a decision has been made. The action of
framing something and putting it on display, must be regarded as exactly
that: an action. To frame something, a selection of the information to
present, (and equally important: the information not to present), must
be made. Through inclusion, and inadvertently exclusion, a narrative is
created. Whether intended or not.</p>
<p>In photography, the term framing also applies to the contents of the
photograph itself. The way the photo is cropped, which subjects are
visible, which subjects aren't, and so on. Besides being used to create
compositional strength, this can completely change the story of the
image. <mark>(fig. soldier)</mark></p>
<p>This can also be seen on image based social media platforms like
Instagram. Everything we share on such platforms is heavily curated.
This is true regardless of the subject matter. Whether it is a perfect
influencer-lifestyle-food-post, an artist’s portfolio, or a purposefully
ugly finsta<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> selfie. This (fictional) digital
representation of ourselves only shows others what we allow it to show
others. We can learn a lot about the way the author wants to be
perceived by looking at their curatorial choices.</p>
<p>Framing may also refer to a term used in criminal law when an
innocent person is "framed" for a crime they did not commit. This may
occur through fabricating or planting evidence. In this example, a false
narrative is created through the presence or absence of proof for a
crime. American Comedian Dave Chapelle has a joke that perfectly
explains framing in this context, while also commenting on the issue of
racial profiling of African Americans by the police. He explains that as
a black man he was afraid to call the police when his house got broken
into. The police would probably think that he was the burglar and not
the owner. He pretends to be the policeman, knocks himself unconscious
and says: "Apparently this man broke in and hung-up pictures of his
family everywhere, well... let's sprinkle some crack on him and let's
get out of here."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>3. To endow with importance</p>
<p>As we just concluded, each act of framing is the result of a curation
(though not necessarily deliberate or conscious). Because of this, we
can assume that whatever is framed holds some degree of importance to
the framer. A grandparent framing a drawing made by their grandchild is
an obvious example <mark>(fig. kids drawing)</mark>. The grandparent
probably won't care much about the artistic value of the drawing because
it is the grandchild that is important to them.</p>
<p>With this logic, we can look at the act of framing as a ritual that
bestows a certain validity and authority over the framed. A lacklustre
drawing that is hung on the refrigerator may be ugly, but the mere fact
that it was put on display is a statement that tells anyone who sees it,
that the drawing is important to the fridge-owner. Even though there was
not literal frame in this example, the act of putting an item on
display, can be regarded as framing. Making it no different than an
expensive gilded frame in a museum.</p>
<p>If we look at a frame beyond its physical container as the
institution it represents, we start to see how the credibility of the
author is transmitted to the contents by the used medium. Think of the
instantly recognisable blue envelopes that have become synonymous with
the Dutch tax administration <mark>(fig. envelope)</mark>. If these
bills were instead handwritten in coloured pencils, covered in sparkly
stickers, and full of grammatical errors, we would question their
legitimacy and be hesitant to pay them.</p>
<p>But the opposite is also true. A veil of credibility and truthfulness
can be created by replicating or appropriating certain institutional
aesthetics. A malicious example of this is phishing emails, pretending
to be a legitimate service to scam unwary victims. Another, more
light-hearted example happened in 2017, when twitch-streamer A.J. Lester
illegally broadcasted a pay-per-view UFC fight by holding a gaming
controller and pretending to be playing a game, instead of watching a
live event<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. <mark>(fig. livestream)</mark>.</p>

<p>4. To index the external.</p>
<p>A frame is a border between two worlds, a separator between inside
and outside, a binary divider between what is and what isn't. Humans
(and other animals for that matter) recognise patterns and index the
things we experience by comparing them to previous encounters, which –in
primal terms– allows us to understand, process, and survive. Think of
the importance of being able to tell food and danger apart in a
cave(hu)man scenario. In this example, the frame is a border surrounding
different conceptual boxes in our head. In his 1965 work entitled "One
and three chairs"<mark>(fig. chairs)</mark>, Joseph Kosuth presents
three embodiments of a chair: A chair, a photograph of that same chair,
and a dictionary definition of a chair. With this work he starts a
discourse about semantics and our relationship to external concepts.</p>
<p>But of course, we can also find more literal examples of borders.
Humans have sectioned off territory with lines on maps, and borders on
land, to indicate where one nation state ends and the other starts.
We've subdivided geographic masses into regions according to the
language, dialects, history, and traditions of those regions.
<mark>(fig. asterix?)</mark>. But not all territories are (hu)manmade, a
territory can also consist of a physiological limitation within an
ecosystem. A fish and a frog that live in the same pond have different
territories, simply because a frog is an amphibian and can go on land.
<mark>(fig. pond)</mark>. But animal territories are not only defined by
their physical capabilities. A 2013 documentary produced by the British
television series "Horizon" entitled "The Secret Life of the Cat",
follows 50 domestic cats by equipping them with cameras and GPS trackers
<mark>(fig. cat map)</mark> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. In this documentary we
discover that cats have much more intricate territorial dynamics and
habits than previously thought.</p>
<p>A frame is not only the border between worlds, but it also dictates
the laws and hierarchies that govern these worlds, and not only the
bureaucratic judicial laws of countries. Imagine, for example, the top
view of an apartment layout. The apartment is divided into multiple
rooms by its walls, these could be seen as frames of the house. Each
room (or section) has different rules and expectations of what they are
"supposed" to look like, what activities take place in them etc. These
expectations are socially constructed concepts that live in our
heads.</p>
<p>Let's take a bathroom for instance. we might not have seen every
bathroom ever, but as soon as we spot a toilet bowl, a sink, and perhaps
some square tiles we know what we're dealing with. We also recognise the
nuances these attributes carry. If we see a toilet bowl discarded in the
street or on display in a store, we know that they are not intended for
use. But now imagine if we didn't have this pattern-recognising system
in our brain, and every time we would visit a unfamiliar bathroom, we
would have to rediscover how to do our business. It would be as if
you're on a holiday in a country with foreign bathroom traditions, and
you haven't developed a successful technique yet <mark>(fig.toilet
sign)</mark>.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that this type of pattern-recognition is
based on previous input. This means that the resulting conclusions
should not be regarded as any sort of absolute truth. This of course,
becomes especially relevant when dealing with artificial intelligence,
which is completely based on pattern-recognition and data input and
therefore susceptible to pre-existing biases.</p>
<p>In a conversation with Femke Snelting and Jara Rocha, following a
screening of her work "The Fragility of Life", Simone Niquille compares
anthropometric efforts to "...an attempt to translate the human body
into numbers. Be it for the sake of comparison, efficiency, policing."<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. In Allan Sekula's article "The body
and the archive" he argues against these types of practices by saying
that "The photographic archive's components are not conventional lexical
units, but rather are subject to the circumstantial character of all
that is photographable."<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and that therefore they should not
be regarded as empirical units of measurement.</p>

<p>5. To drip with decoration</p>
<p>Another important quality of frames is their ability to decorate and
enhance. A frame can add another layer of information and immersion to
its content. Because this section is rather obvious, I won't go on a
long tangent with my examples for this section.<br />
A renaissance painting in museum conveys a completely different meaning
depending on how it is framed. A bombastic gilded frame convey can a
feeling of and status and importance, whereas a sober wooden frame
conveys something completely different.</p>
<p>This also holds true for other forms of media. A retelling of a story
with lots of details and context, can be a lot more interesting than a
dry summary of facts.</p>

<h2 id="instances-of-frames">Instances of frames</h2>
<p>The early frames of history <mark>(fig. fayum frame)</mark></p>
<p>Possibly the earliest remaining examples of frames as we know them,
are the ones originating from ancient Egypt (Fayum) and date to between
the first and fourth centuries AD<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. These frames contained
wooden panels with paintings of gods. Though today only three panels
have survived with their original frames, research concludes that it was
a much more common practice. Besides these panels, ornamental borders
were also used in paintings and pottery as a method to divide
scenes.</p>
<p>The technique of using frames as a narrative tool remained relevant
throughout time. In gothic and renaissance art, triptychs are a popular
carrier of media. A triptych is a set of three interconnected frames or
panels, often connected through hinges. A famous example of this is "The
Garden of Earthly Delights" <mark>(fig. hieronymus bosch)</mark>, by
Hieronymus Bosch. By effectively splitting the painting into three, the
painting tells a story from multiple perspectives. In Bosch's garden we
simultaneously see Eden, Hell, and Earth.</p>
<p>In one of their lectures, Sam Fogg and Peter Schade look at Dieric
Bouts' work entitled "Justice of Emperor Otto III: Beheading of the
Innocent Count and Ordeal by Fire"<mark>(fig. emperor otto)</mark>. Here
we see another clever way frames have been used to create immersion.
"The painting features an architectural element that references the
frame itself"<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. We find a similar instance to this
approach in "The San Giobbe Altarpiece"<mark>(fig. San Giobbe)</mark>,
by Giovanni Bellini, which brilliantly emulates the architecture of the
chapel in which it was originally presented. Currently, the work is on
display in Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. Where it is unfortunately
stripped from its original frame and context. <mark>(fig. San
Giobbe)</mark>, "It is important to think about a painting out of the
context of its original frame as just a fragment"<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>

<p>– Frames in illuminated parchment and the Kelmscott Press</p>
<p>We see another interesting usage of frames in medieval books, which
follow a rich tradition of ornamental borders and illustrated margins.
Because these books were made long before the invention of the printing
press, each specimen was crafted through countless hours of meticulous
and precise hand labour. This job, tasked to monks in a monastery, was
very difficult and often took place under less-than-ideal circumstances.
We know this because some scribes wrote little complaints in the books.
An example of such complaints is "Writing is excessive drudgery. It
crooks your back, it dims your sight, it twists your stomach and your
sides,"<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These types of scribbles are referred to as marginalia: That which
takes place in the margins of a book. Marginalia can also refer to the
illustrations and decorations in the margins of these medieval books.
From these illustrations we can learn about the culture and the
knowledge of the time in which the book was crafted. Often, they
contained depictions of animals that show that the artist had clearly
never seen the animal in person, resulting in creatures with absurd
proportions <mark>(fig. weird animal)</mark>. Another recurring subject
matter are knights engaged in battle with snails. Though there isn't a
definitive explanation for it, historian Lilian Randall proposes that
the snails <mark>(fig. snails)</mark> are a metaphor for the Lombards (a
Germanic people who ran the Lombard Kingdom) <a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If we take a "small" leap in time to 19th century, we see that books
have become much more widely available through industrialisation and the
means of mass production. Mass production is a process that prioritises
quantity over quality, resulting in a degradation of quality in produced
goods, including books. William Morris was a designer who was at the
forefront of the Arts and Crafts movement, which protested the decline
of design standards by creating beautifully decorative and detailed
work. One such project was the Kelmscott Press<a href="#"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
–founded by Morris–, a publishing house that took great inspiration from
medieval illuminated manuscripts, while using contemporary printing
techniques. The books they published featured frames and initials akin
to their predecessors, but instead of calligraphing by hand, they
printed reusable woodblocks designs<mark>(fig. kelmscott press)</mark>.
Similar to the medieval marginalia, the treatment and production methods
of books that were produced under –what became known as– the Fine Press
movement, reflect the circumstances of their creation.</p>

<p>– Framed through photography</p>
<p>You may have heard the phrase "seeing is believing", but what not
many people know, is that this phrase is only part of a longer quote by
17th-century historian Thomas Fuller: "seeing is believing, but feeling
is the truth". The original quote suggests that we can only fully
understand something by experiencing it. Nevertheless, the way the quote
has been shortened gives it a new meaning and use. Instead, now the
quote seems to be a sceptic way to demand visual proof or demonstration
from another party, as if to say, "I don't believe your statement, until
you show me otherwise". A more recent, internet-culture version of the
quote is "pics or it didn't happen", which specifically asks for
photographic evidence.</p>
<p>But what is the validity of photographic evidence today? Because not
long after the invention of the camera, followed the practice of photo
manipulation. Early versions of this included precise manual tampering
with negatives, manipulating the exposure in the darkroom and more.
Today we're all too familiar with digital photo retouching and editing
software. Because of how widely accessible these tools are; it seems
like we should not apply "seeing is believing" to photo's any
longer.</p>
<p>A somewhat recent example of a tampered photo getting media attention
was the Paris Hilton t-shirt moment<mark>(fig. hilton)</mark>. Since the
early 2010's, an image of Hilton has been floating around, wearing a
tank top with the words "STOP BEING POOR" on it. The image turned out to
be a hoax, because when the image resurfaced in early 2021, the
superstar took to social media to reveal that the shirt had said "STOP
BEING DESPERATE" instead.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this thesis (2024), it seems like this type of
photographic framing will only become easier, more popular, and more
indistinguishable from reality. In the past years A.I. image generators
have made huge leaps in quality and accessibility. It has become a
popular trend to share weird and funny images created with such tools,
on twitter. Among them, there are images of gameshow host Steve Harvey
in a forest, running away from a hellish demon<mark>(fig.
harvey)</mark>. And there are dashcam images of Actress and CEO of
lifestyle company GOOP, Gwyneth Paltrow, spotted on the side of a
highway at night<mark>(fig. gwyneth)</mark>. The big giveaway that these
images aren't real, is of course the fact that they are depicting scenes
that are completely absurd. But the quality of the images themselves are
freakishly convincing. Marshall McLuhan writes in his chapter "The
medium is the message" that "the “content” of any medium blinds us to
the character of the medium."<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. Meaning that the
medium in which our interactions take place has a profound influence on
our behaviour, regardless of the content of said medium. Perhaps the
existence of a perfectly lifelike image generator will completely change
our behaviour towards visual media, and likely already has.</p>

<p>– F**** the system (Frame the system)</p>
<p>On January 24th, 2024, twitter user @Locwittati posted an image of a
wall with a hole in it, covered up by a picture frame, to make it look
like the damaged drywall was instead part of an artwork <mark>(fig.
wall)</mark>. The tweet was captioned: "I had an apartment inspection
"<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. In the KABK men's bathroom in the
graphic design department, the walls are completely covered in graffiti
tags, but among them is a small empty wooding picture frame, placed on
top of some deep bathroom ponderings and inspirational quotes. On top of
the frame somebody wrote "Does art make the frame or the frame makes
art?" <mark>(fig. kabk toilet)</mark> And though both references might
seem a bit silly, they open a discourse about the rigid, formal
traditions and expectations within art. And while discussing these norms
we must also mention Marcel Duchamp's Fountain (1917), a Dada sculpture
that challenged those same conventions <mark>(fig. fountain)</mark>.
(There is some discourse about whether Duchamp was the creator of this
work, or if it should be attributed to Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>).</p>
<p>Today, a popular form of visual expression takes place on trashcans,
electricity boxes, traffic lights, and other urban furniture <mark>(fig.
urban furniture)</mark>. We find all of these covered in graffiti and
stickers. Most, if not all of these types of urban ornamentation would
be considered vandalism by the government. But, these same urban items
are often fitted with a reusable frame, that serves as a designated
advertisement spot. In her work, Swedish artist Klara Liden (1979)
recontextualizes these pieces of urban furniture by taking them out of
their original context and presenting them in an exhibition <mark>(fig.
elec boxes)</mark>. Her work is described as "marked by an enduring
exploration of the physical and psychological bounds of the spaces –
both public and private – we inhabit"<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>.
When I see her work, I can't help but be reminded of the Fountain,
because of the way her work highlights the mundane and creates a
platform for more informal forms of visual media. Something about
juxtaposing the graffiti and stickers –which will always be an underdog
to regulated and institutional forms of media– with the "formal" context
of a gallery, just feels so right.</p>

<p>Identity, individuality, and frames of self-expression</p>
<p>In our day-to-day we are often subjected to frames regarding our
identity. We are defined by our dietary restrictions, the music we
listen to, our sexual preference and cultural background. The list goes
on and on. The term pigeonholing (in Dutch "Hokjesdenken", literally
translates to "thinking in boxes") refers to the small grid-like
birdhouses pigeons <mark>(fig. pidgeys)</mark>. are kept in. It
describes a way of categorizing things or people without nuance. This
way of thinking makes assumptions based on stereotypes and disregards
any possibility of individuality. The term is often used in a negative
context, but because we are social creatures, it can also help us
recognize our "tribe" and find our community. In their project
"Exactitudes" (1994 – ongoing) <mark>(fig. gabbers)</mark>., Ari
Versluis and Ellie Uyttenbroek show how "our desire to differentiate
ourselves is also matched by a need to belong to a specific group"<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. In this long-term project, they
exhibit the uniformity within individualistic expression among social
types and sub-cultures. In this case identity is shaped by a common
interest or background.</p>
<p>Simone de Beauvoir famously stated that "One is not born, but rather
becomes, a woman" <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, arguing that femininity isn't a
biological phenomenon, but a result of nurture rather than nature. The
subject –the woman– is shaped by the frame of pre-existing circumstances
–her environment–. A similar thing happens with Judith Butler's "Gender
Performativity". In their 1990 book "Gender Trouble"<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
they argue that gender is something to be performed, rather than
something to be. "Performance" in this context encompasses all forms of
behavioral expression, the way we walk, talk, etc. Butler argues that
this performance is not choreographed by each individual, but that is
the culmination of a long history of gender expression.</p>
<p>Pre-existing norms, conventions and power dynamics flavour our
interactions and forge our malleable sense of self. The fact that we are
not just a pigeon in a hole, but individuals with agency and unique
perspectives, may be the real "human experience". It is a privilege to
acknowledge and embrace each other’s identities, to share our
similarities and celebrate our differences.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Frames are everywhere, they are a an (in)visible structure that holds
context and can be used to create and derive narrative. They influence
the way we perceive the world around us, for better or for worse. It is
important to be aware of the frames that surround our lives to get a
better understanding of the things we engage with.</p>
