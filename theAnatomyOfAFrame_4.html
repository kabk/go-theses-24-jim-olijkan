            <h2>4. To index the external.</h2>
            <p>A frame is a border between two worlds, a separator between inside
            and outside, a binary divider between what is and what isn't. Humans
            (and other animals for that matter) recognise patterns and index the
            things we experience by comparing them to previous encounters, which –in
            primal terms– allows us to understand, process, and survive. Think of
            the importance of being able to tell food and danger apart in a
            cave(hu)man scenario. In this example, the frame is a border surrounding
            different conceptual boxes in our head. In his 1965 work entitled "One
            and three chairs" <span class="clickMe fig9">(fig. 9)</span>, Joseph Kosuth presents
            three embodiments of a chair: A chair, a photograph of that same chair,
            and a dictionary definition of a chair. With this work he starts a
            discourse about semantics and our relationship to external concepts.</p>
            <p>But of course, we can also find more literal examples of borders.
            Humans have sectioned off territory with lines on maps, and borders on
            land, to indicate where one nation state ends and the other starts.
            We've subdivided geographic masses into regions according to the
            language, dialects, history, and traditions of those regions <span class="clickMe fig10">(fig. 10)</span>. But not all territories are (hu)manmade, a
            territory can also consist of a physiological limitation within an
            ecosystem. A fish and a frog that live in the same pond have different
            territories, simply because a frog is an amphibian and can go on land <span class="clickMe fig11">(fig. 11)</span>. But animal territories are not only defined by
            their physical capabilities. A 2013 documentary produced by the British
            television series "Horizon" entitled "The Secret Life of the Cat",
            follows 50 domestic cats by equipping them with cameras and GPS trackers
            <span class="clickMe fig12">(fig. 12)</span> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref5" ><sup>5</sup></a>. In this documentary we
            discover that cats have much more intricate territorial dynamics and
            habits than previously thought.</p>
            <p>A frame is not only the border between worlds, but it also dictates
            the laws and hierarchies that govern these worlds, and not only the
            bureaucratic judicial laws of countries. Imagine, for example, the top
            view of an apartment layout. The apartment is divided into multiple
            rooms by its walls, these could be seen as frames of the house. Each
            room (or section) has different rules and expectations of what they are
            "supposed" to look like, what activities take place in them etc. These
            expectations are socially constructed concepts that live in our
            heads.</p>
            <p>Let's take a bathroom for instance. we might not have seen every
            bathroom ever, but as soon as we spot a toilet bowl, a sink, and perhaps
            some square tiles we know what we're dealing with. We also recognise the
            nuances these attributes carry. If we see a toilet bowl discarded in the
            street or on display in a store, we know that they are not intended for
            use. But now imagine if we didn't have this pattern-recognising system
            in our brain, and every time we would visit a unfamiliar bathroom, we
            would have to rediscover how to do our business. It would be as if
            you're on a holiday in a country with foreign bathroom traditions, and
            you haven't developed a successful technique yet <span class="clickMe fig13">(fig. 13)</span>.</p>
            <p>It is important to emphasize that this type of pattern-recognition is
            based on previous input. This means that the resulting conclusions
            should not be regarded as any sort of absolute truth. This of course,
            becomes especially relevant when dealing with artificial intelligence,
            which is completely based on pattern-recognition and data input and
            therefore susceptible to pre-existing biases.</p>
            <p>In a conversation with Femke Snelting and Jara Rocha, following a
            screening of her work "The Fragility of Life", Simone Niquille compares
            anthropometric efforts to "...an attempt to translate the human body
            into numbers. Be it for the sake of comparison, efficiency, policing."<a

            that "The photographic archive's components are not conventional lexical
            units, but rather are subject to the circumstantial character of all
            that is photographable."<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"

              <h2>4. To index the external.</h2>
            <p>A frame is a border between two worlds, a separator between inside
            and outside, a binary divider between what is and what isn't. Humans
            (and other animals for that matter) recognise patterns and index the
            things we experience by comparing them to previous encounters, which –in
            primal terms– allows us to understand, process, and survive. Think of
            the importance of being able to tell food and danger apart in a
            cave(hu)man scenario. In this example, the frame is a border surrounding
            different conceptual boxes in our head. In his 1965 work entitled "One
            and three chairs" <span class="clickMe fig9">(fig. 9)</span>, Joseph Kosuth presents
            three embodiments of a chair: A chair, a photograph of that same chair,
            and a dictionary definition of a chair. With this work he starts a
            discourse about semantics and our relationship to external concepts.</p>
            <p>But of course, we can also find more literal examples of borders.
            Humans have sectioned off territory with lines on maps, and borders on
            land, to indicate where one nation state ends and the other starts.
            We've subdivided geographic masses into regions according to the
            language, dialects, history, and traditions of those regions <span class="clickMe fig10">(fig. 10)</span>. But not all territories are (hu)manmade, a
            territory can also consist of a physiological limitation within an
            ecosystem. A fish and a frog that live in the same pond have different
            territories, simply because a frog is an amphibian and can go on land <span class="clickMe fig11">(fig. 11)</span>. But animal territories are not only defined by
            their physical capabilities. A 2013 documentary produced by the British
            television series "Horizon" entitled "The Secret Life of the Cat",
            follows 50 domestic cats by equipping them with cameras and GPS trackers
            <span class="clickMe fig12">(fig. 12)</span> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref5" ><sup>5</sup></a>. In this documentary we
            discover that cats have much more intricate territorial dynamics and
            habits than previously thought.</p>
            <p>A frame is not only the border between worlds, but it also dictates
            the laws and hierarchies that govern these worlds, and not only the
            bureaucratic judicial laws of countries. Imagine, for example, the top
            view of an apartment layout. The apartment is divided into multiple
            rooms by its walls, these could be seen as frames of the house. Each
            room (or section) has different rules and expectations of what they are
            "supposed" to look like, what activities take place in them etc. These
            expectations are socially constructed concepts that live in our
            heads.</p>
            <p>Let's take a bathroom for instance. we might not have seen every
            bathroom ever, but as soon as we spot a toilet bowl, a sink, and perhaps
            some square tiles we know what we're dealing with. We also recognise the
            nuances these attributes carry. If we see a toilet bowl discarded in the
            street or on display in a store, we know that they are not intended for
            use. But now imagine if we didn't have this pattern-recognising system
            in our brain, and every time we would visit a unfamiliar bathroom, we
            would have to rediscover how to do our business. It would be as if
            you're on a holiday in a country with foreign bathroom traditions, and
            you haven't developed a successful technique yet <span class="clickMe fig13">(fig. 13)</span>.</p>
            <p>It is important to emphasize that this type of pattern-recognition is
            based on previous input. This means that the resulting conclusions
            should not be regarded as any sort of absolute truth. This of course,
            becomes especially relevant when dealing with artificial intelligence,
            which is completely based on pattern-recognition and data input and
            therefore susceptible to pre-existing biases.</p>
            <p>In a conversation with Femke Snelting and Jara Rocha, following a
            screening of her work "The Fragility of Life", Simone Niquille compares
            anthropometric efforts to "...an attempt to translate the human body
            into numbers. Be it for the sake of comparison, efficiency, policing."<a
            href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
            ><sup>6</sup></a>. In Allan Sekula's article "The body
            and the archive" he argues against these types of practices by saying
            that "The photographic archive's components are not conventional lexical
            units, but rather are subject to the circumstantial character of all
            that is photographable."<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
            ><sup>7</sup></a> and that therefore they should not
            be regarded as empirical units of measurement.</p>
