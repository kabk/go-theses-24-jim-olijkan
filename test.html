            <h2>Temporary title.</h2>
            <p>As we just concluded, each act of framing is the result of an active choice (though not necessarily
              deliberate or conscious). Because of this, we can assu<span class="clickMe fig3">(fig. 3)</span> me that
              whatever is framed, holds some degree of
              importance to the framer. A grandparent framing a school portrait of their grandchild is an obvious
              example.
              The grandparent probably won't care much, whether the photo turned out well, because their grandchild is
              important to them.</p>

            <p> With this logic, we can look at the act of framing as a ritual that bestows a certain "true-ness" and
              authority over the framed. But don't be fooled, this authority is only a projected reality of the author.
              If
              we look at the Instagram page of a person who flexes[1] their expensive wristwatch, we might be tempted to
              believe that the author doing well, financially speaking.<span class="clickMe fig1">(fig. 1)</span> This

                breaks</a>hould remember that the image is a heavily
              curated, preselected slice of life, that says very little about real life. We can, however, learn about
              the
              author by trying to understand their intended narrative. In this case we might deduct that the author
              values
              materialistic things.</p>
            <!-- <div id="pixel-to-watch"></div> -->
            <p>The previo<span class="clickMe fig4">(fig. 4)</span> us example about the materialistic Instagram user
              might
              seem unimportant, but if we look put the
              narratives in our history books under the same microscope, we realise that no story is an absolute
              objective
              truth. Written from a certain position of power, context, and bias.</p>
