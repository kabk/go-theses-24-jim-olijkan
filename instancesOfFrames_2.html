            <h2>Frames in illuminated parchment and the Kelmscott Press</h2>
            <p>We see another interesting usage of frames in medieval books, which
            follow a rich tradition of ornamental borders and illustrated margins.
            Because these books were made long before the invention of the printing
            press, each specimen was crafted through countless hours of meticulous
            and precise hand labour. This job, tasked to monks in a monastery, was
            very difficult and often took place under less-than-ideal circumstances.
            We know this because some scribes wrote little complaints in the books.
            An example of such complaints is "Writing is excessive drudgery. It
            crooks your back, it dims your sight, it twists your stomach and your
            sides,"<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
            ><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>These types of scribbles are referred to as marginalia: That which
            takes place in the margins of a book. Marginalia can also refer to the
            illustrations and decorations in the margins of these medieval books.
            From these illustrations we can learn about the culture and the
            knowledge of the time in which the book was crafted. Often, they
            contained depictions of animals that show that the artist had clearly
            never seen the animal in person, resulting in creatures with absurd
            proportions <span class="clickMe fig19">(fig. 19)</span>. Another recurring subject
            matter are knights engaged in battle with snails. Though there isn't a
            definitive explanation for it, historian Lilian Randall proposes that
            the snails <span class="clickMe fig20">(fig. 20)</span> are a metaphor for the Lombards (a
            Germanic people who ran the Lombard Kingdom) <a href="#fn12"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
            ><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>If we take a "small" leap in time to 19th century, we see that books
            have become much more widely available through industrialisation and the
            means of mass production. Mass production is a process that prioritises
            quantity over quality, resulting in a degradation of quality in produced
            goods, including books. William Morris was a designer who was at the
            forefront of the Arts and Crafts movement, which protested the decline
            of design standards by creating beautifully decorative and detailed
            work. One such project was the Kelmscott Press<a href="#fn13"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" ><sup>13</sup></a>
            –founded by Morris–, a publishing house that took great inspiration from
            medieval illuminated manuscripts, while using contemporary printing
            techniques. The books they published featured frames and initials akin
            to their predecessors, but instead of calligraphing by hand, they
            printed reusable woodblocks designs <span class="clickMe fig21">(fig. 21)</span>.
            Similar to the medieval marginalia, the treatment and production methods
            of books that were produced under –what became known as– the Fine Press
            movement, reflect the circumstances of their creation.</p>

        <h2>Frames in illuminated parchment and the Kelmscott Press</h2>
        <p>We see another interesting usage of frames in medieval books, which
        follow a rich tradition of ornamental borders and illustrated margins.
        Because these books were made long before the invention of the printing
        press, each specimen was crafted through countless hours of meticulous
        and precise hand labour. This job, tasked to monks in a monastery, was
        very difficult and often took place under less-than-ideal circumstances.
        We know this because some scribes wrote little complaints in the books.
        An example of such complaints is "Writing is excessive drudgery. It
        crooks your back, it dims your sight, it twists your stomach and your
        sides,"<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
        ><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>These types of scribbles are referred to as marginalia: That which
        takes place in the margins of a book. Marginalia can also refer to the
        illustrations and decorations in the margins of these medieval books.
        From these illustrations we can learn about the culture and the
        knowledge of the time in which the book was crafted. Often, they
        contained depictions of animals that show that the artist had clearly
        never seen the animal in person, resulting in creatures with absurd
        proportions <span class="clickMe fig19">(fig. 19)</span>. Another recurring subject
        matter are knights engaged in battle with snails. Though there isn't a
        definitive explanation for it, historian Lilian Randall proposes that
        the snails <span class="clickMe fig20">(fig. 20)</span> are a metaphor for the Lombards (a
        Germanic people who ran the Lombard Kingdom) <a href="#fn12"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
        ><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>If we take a "small" leap in time to 19th century, we see that books
        have become much more widely available through industrialisation and the
        means of mass production. Mass production is a process that prioritises
        quantity over quality, resulting in a degradation of quality in produced
        goods, including books. William Morris was a designer who was at the
        forefront of the Arts and Crafts movement, which protested the decline
        of design standards by creating beautifully decorative and detailed
        work. One such project was the Kelmscott Press<a href="#fn13"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" ><sup>13</sup></a>
        –founded by Morris–, a publishing house that took great inspiration from
        medieval illuminated manuscripts, while using contemporary printing
        techniques. The books they published featured frames and initials akin
        to their predecessors, but instead of calligraphing by hand, they
        printed reusable woodblocks designs <span class="clickMe fig21">(fig. 21)</span>.
        Similar to the medieval marginalia, the treatment and production methods
        of books that were produced under –what became known as– the Fine Press
        movement, reflect the circumstances of their creation.</p>
