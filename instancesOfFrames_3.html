            <h2>Framed through photography</h2>
            <p>You may have heard the phrase "seeing is believing", but what not
            many people know, is that this phrase is only part of a longer quote by
            17th-century historian Thomas Fuller: "seeing is believing, but feeling
            is the truth". The original quote suggests that we can only fully
            understand something by experiencing it. Nevertheless, the way the quote
            has been shortened gives it a new meaning and use. Instead, now the
            quote seems to be a sceptic way to demand visual proof or demonstration
            from another party, as if to say, "I don't believe your statement, until
            you show me otherwise". A more recent, internet-culture version of the
            quote is "pics or it didn't happen", which specifically asks for
            photographic evidence.</p>
            <p>But what is the validity of photographic evidence today? Because not
            long after the invention of the camera, followed the practice of photo
            manipulation. Early versions of this included precise manual tampering
            with negatives, manipulating the exposure in the darkroom and more.
            Today we're all too familiar with digital photo retouching and editing
            software. Because of how widely accessible these tools are; it seems
            like we should not apply "seeing is believing" to photo's any
            longer.</p>
            <p>A somewhat recent example of a tampered photo getting media attention
            was the Paris Hilton t-shirt moment <span class="clickMe fig22">(fig. 22)</span>. Since the
            early 2010's, an image of Hilton has been floating around, wearing a
            tank top with the words "STOP BEING POOR" on it. The image turned out to
            be a hoax, because when the image resurfaced in early 2021, the
            superstar took to social media to reveal that the shirt had said "STOP
            BEING DESPERATE" instead.</p>
            <p>At the time of writing this thesis (2024), it seems like this type of
            photographic framing will only become easier, more popular, and more
            indistinguishable from reality. In the past years A.I. image generators
            have made huge leaps in quality and accessibility. It has become a
            popular trend to share weird and funny images created with such tools,
            on twitter. Among them, there are images of gameshow host Steve Harvey
            in a forest, running away from a hellish demon <span class="clickMe fig23">(fig. 23)</span>. And there are dashcam images of Actress and CEO of
            lifestyle company GOOP, Gwyneth Paltrow, spotted on the side of a
            highway at night <span class="clickMe fig24">(fig. 24)</span>. The big giveaway that these
            images aren't real, is of course the fact that they are depicting scenes
            that are completely absurd. But the quality of the images themselves are
            freakishly convincing. Marshall McLuhan writes in his chapter "The
            medium is the message" that "the “content” of any medium blinds us to
            the character of the medium."<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref14" ><sup>14</sup></a>. Meaning that the
            medium in which our interactions take place has a profound influence on
            our behaviour, regardless of the content of said medium. Perhaps the
            existence of a perfectly lifelike image generator will completely change
            our behaviour towards visual media, and likely already has.</p>

        <h2>Framed through photography</h2>
        <p>You may have heard the phrase "seeing is believing", but what not
        many people know, is that this phrase is only part of a longer quote by
        17th-century historian Thomas Fuller: "seeing is believing, but feeling
        is the truth". The original quote suggests that we can only fully
        understand something by experiencing it. Nevertheless, the way the quote
        has been shortened gives it a new meaning and use. Instead, now the
        quote seems to be a sceptic way to demand visual proof or demonstration
        from another party, as if to say, "I don't believe your statement, until
        you show me otherwise". A more recent, internet-culture version of the
        quote is "pics or it didn't happen", which specifically asks for
        photographic evidence.</p>
        <p>But what is the validity of photographic evidence today? Because not
        long after the invention of the camera, followed the practice of photo
        manipulation. Early versions of this included precise manual tampering
        with negatives, manipulating the exposure in the darkroom and more.
        Today we're all too familiar with digital photo retouching and editing
        software. Because of how widely accessible these tools are; it seems
        like we should not apply "seeing is believing" to photo's any
        longer.</p>
        <p>A somewhat recent example of a tampered photo getting media attention
        was the Paris Hilton t-shirt moment <span class="clickMe fig22">(fig. 22)</span>. Since the
        early 2010's, an image of Hilton has been floating around, wearing a
        tank top with the words "STOP BEING POOR" on it. The image turned out to
        be a hoax, because when the image resurfaced in early 2021, the
        superstar took to social media to reveal that the shirt had said "STOP
        BEING DESPERATE" instead.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing this thesis (2024), it seems like this type of
        photographic framing will only become easier, more popular, and more
        indistinguishable from reality. In the past years A.I. image generators
        have made huge leaps in quality and accessibility. It has become a
        popular trend to share weird and funny images created with such tools,
        on twitter. Among them, there are images of gameshow host Steve Harvey
        in a forest, running away from a hellish demon <span class="clickMe fig23">(fig. 23)</span>. And there are dashcam images of Actress and CEO of
        lifestyle company GOOP, Gwyneth Paltrow, spotted on the side of a
        highway at night <span class="clickMe fig24">(fig. 24)</span>. The big giveaway that these
        images aren't real, is of course the fact that they are depicting scenes
        that are completely absurd. But the quality of the images themselves are
        freakishly convincing. Marshall McLuhan writes in his chapter "The
        medium is the message" that "the “content” of any medium blinds us to
        the character of the medium."<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref14" ><sup>14</sup></a>. Meaning that the
        medium in which our interactions take place has a profound influence on
        our behaviour, regardless of the content of said medium. Perhaps the
        existence of a perfectly lifelike image generator will completely change
        our behaviour towards visual media, and likely already has.</p>
