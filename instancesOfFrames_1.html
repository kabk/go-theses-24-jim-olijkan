            <h2>The early frames of history</h2>
            <p>Possibly the earliest remaining examples of frames as we know them,
            are the ones originating from ancient Egypt (Fayum) and date to between
            the first and fourth centuries AD<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref8" ><sup>8</sup></a>. These frames contained
            wooden panels with paintings of gods <span class="clickMe fig14">(fig. 14)</span>. Though today only three panels
            have survived with their original frames, research concludes that it was
            a much more common practice. Besides these panels, ornamental borders
            were also used in paintings and pottery as a method to divide
            scenes.</p>
            <p>The technique of using frames as a narrative tool remained relevant
            throughout time. In gothic and renaissance art, triptychs are a popular
            carrier of media. A triptych is a set of three interconnected frames or
            panels, often connected through hinges. A famous example of this is "The
            Garden of Earthly Delights" <span class="clickMe fig15">(fig. 15)</span>, by
            Hieronymus Bosch. By effectively splitting the painting into three, the
            painting tells a story from multiple perspectives. In Bosch's garden we
            simultaneously see Eden, Hell, and Earth.</p>
            <p>In one of their lectures, Sam Fogg and Peter Schade look at Dieric
            Bouts' work entitled "Justice of Emperor Otto III: Beheading of the
            Innocent Count and Ordeal by Fire" <span class="clickMe fig16">(fig. 16)</span>. Here
            we see another clever way frames have been used to create immersion.

        display in Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. Where it is unfortunately
        stripped from its original frame and context. <span class="clickMe fig18">(fig. 18)</span>, "It is important to think about a painting out of the
        context of its original frame as just a fragment"<a href="#fn10"
