            <p>In our day-to-day we are often subjected to frames regarding our
            identity. We are defined by our dietary restrictions, the music we
            listen to, our sexual preference and cultural background. The list goes
            on and on. The term pigeonholing (in Dutch "Hokjesdenken", literally
            translates to "thinking in boxes") refers to the small grid-like
            birdhouses pigeons <span class="clickMe fig32">(fig. 32)</span>. are kept in. It
            describes a way of categorizing things or people without nuance. This
            way of thinking makes assumptions based on stereotypes and disregards
            any possibility of individuality. The term is often used in a negative
            context, but because we are social creatures, it can also help us
            recognize our "tribe" and find our community. In their project
            "Exactitudes" (1994 – ongoing) <span class="clickMe fig33">(fig. 33)</span>., Ari
            Versluis and Ellie Uyttenbroek show how "our desire to differentiate

        context, but because we are social creatures, it can also help us
        recognize our "tribe" and find our community. In their project
        "Exactitudes" (1994 – ongoing) <span class="clickMe fig33">(fig. 33)</span>., Ari
        Versluis and Ellie Uyttenbroek show how "our desire to differentiate
        ourselves is also matched by a need to belong to a specific group"<a
        href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
        ><sup>18</sup></a>. In this long-term project, they
        exhibit the uniformity within individualistic expression among social
        types and sub-cultures. In this case identity is shaped by a common
        interest or background.</p>
        <p>Simone de Beauvoir famously stated that "One is not born, but rather
        becomes, a woman" <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
        ><sup>19</sup></a>, arguing that femininity isn't a
        biological phenomenon, but a result of nurture rather than nature. The
        subject –the woman– is shaped by the frame of pre-existing circumstances
        –her environment–. A similar thing happens with Judith Butler's "Gender
        Performativity". In their 1990 book "Gender Trouble"<a href="#fn20"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" ><sup>20</sup></a>
        they argue that gender is something to be performed, rather than
        something to be. "Performance" in this context encompasses all forms of
        behavioral expression, the way we walk, talk, etc. Butler argues that
        this performance is not choreographed by each individual, but that is
        the culmination of a long history of gender expression.</p>
        <p>Pre-existing norms, conventions and power dynamics flavour our
        interactions and forge our malleable sense of self. The fact that we are
        not just a pigeon in a hole, but individuals with agency and unique
        perspectives, may be the real "human experience". It is a privilege to
        acknowledge and embrace each other’s identities, to share our
        similarities and celebrate our differences.</p>
