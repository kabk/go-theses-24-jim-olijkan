            <h2>2. Inclusion through exclusion</h2>
            <p>A frame is a curation and construction of narrative. When we frame an
            artwork or photo and put it on the wall, something interesting has
            happened. Regardless of whether the picture is a lovely panorama of a
            meadow during a sunset, a happy family portrait or a pseudo rustic "live
            laugh love" home decoration: a decision has been made. The action of
            framing something and putting it on display, must be regarded as exactly
            that: an action. To frame something, a selection of the information to
            present, (and equally important: the information not to present), must
            be made. Through inclusion, and inadvertently exclusion, a narrative is
            created. Whether intended or not.</p>
            <p>In photography, the term framing also applies to the contents of the
            photograph itself. The way the photo is cropped, which subjects are
            visible, which subjects aren't, and so on. Besides being used to create
            compositional strength, this can completely change the story of the
            image <span class="clickMe fig5">(fig. 5)</span>.</p>
            <p>This can also be seen on image based social media platforms like
            Instagram. Everything we share on such platforms is heavily curated.
            This is true regardless of the subject matter. Whether it is a perfect
            influencer-lifestyle-food-post, an artist’s portfolio, or a purposefully
            ugly finsta<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
            ><sup>2</sup></a> selfie. This (fictional) digital
            representation of ourselves only shows others what we allow it to show
            others. We can learn a lot about the way the author wants to be
            perceived by looking at their curatorial choices.</p>
            <p>Framing may also refer to a term used in criminal law when an
            innocent person is "framed" for a crime they did not commit. This may
            occur through fabricating or planting evidence. In this example, a false
            narrative is created through the presence or absence of proof for a
            crime. American Comedian Dave Chapelle has a joke that perfectly
            explains framing in this context, while also commenting on the issue of
            racial profiling of African Americans by the police. He explains that as
            a black man he was afraid to call the police when his house got broken
            into. The police would probably think that he was the burglar and not
            the owner. He pretends to be the policeman, knocks himself unconscious
            and says: "Apparently this man broke in and hung-up pictures of his
            family everywhere, well... let's sprinkle some crack on him and let's
            get out of here."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"

        occur through fabricating or planting evidence. In this example, a false
        narrative is created through the presence or absence of proof for a
        crime. American Comedian Dave Chapelle has a joke that perfectly
        explains framing in this context, while also commenting on the issue of
        racial profiling of African Americans by the police. He explains that as
        a black man he was afraid to call the police when his house got broken
        into. The police would probably think that he was the burglar and not
        the owner. He pretends to be the policeman, knocks himself unconscious
        and says: "Apparently this man broke in and hung-up pictures of his
        family everywhere, well... let's sprinkle some crack on him and let's
        get out of here."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
