            <h2>1. Strengthening with structure</h2>
<p>Let's start with perhaps the most basic property of a frame. As I
mentioned before, <em>structure</em> is an important quality that all
frames possess. In this context, structure can be seen in the literal
sense, as an almost architectural quality: A tangible structure or
system, serving as a physical support as part of another object with a
greater function. Think for example, about the frames in sunglasses and
bicycles. A painting doesn't only have a frame for aesthetical purposes,
but also to protect the canvas during transport, or other outside
influences <span class="clickMe fig3">(fig. 3)</span>. In the context of talking
about the characteristics of a frame as an anatomy, it should also be
said that the structural qualities of a frame are not dissimilar to the
properties of a skeleton (either endo- or exoskeleton) <span class="clickMe fig4">(fig. 4)</span>.</p>
<p>But the idea of structure also applies to less literal instances of
frames. If I would have a conversation with one of my peers, I might
colloquially mention the term "covid times". We would both know that we
are talking about a period that lasted from 2020 to somewhere around
2022/2023. In this case an event or experience is framed by a certain
calendar system. The structure in this example comes from a (hu)manmade
system, invented to help us understand time more easily. Not only would
the event be framed by a calendar system, but our understanding and
usage of this system would also be shaped by cultural and geographical
frames. If somebody else from a different culture (or even planet), that
measures time by a different metric, would have the same conversation,
they might reach different conclusions. In this case culture can also be
seen as a frame. It is a collection of contexts and backgrounds that
form a rigid blueprint for traditions, values, and ways of
understanding.</p>
